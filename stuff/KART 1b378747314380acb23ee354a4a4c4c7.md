# General Description

---

The project consists of equipping a competition kart with the ability to operate autonomously, integrating perception, control, and actuation systems.

# Definition of Objectives and Problems Solved

## Main Objective

The main objective is to develop a platform on which to prototype different systems related to autonomous operation. After validation, these systems could be implemented in the single-seater race car. This accelerates the development of innovations and reduces iteration costs, minimizing the risk of failures that affect the independent development of the vehicle.

## Secondary Objective:

In parallel, since the base is a classic competition kart that has been inactive for a prolonged period, there is a secondary objective: to restore it both functionally and aesthetically to ensure its safety and provide a comfortable working environment.

| PROBLEM | SOLUTION |
| --- | --- |
| The kart lacks a propulsion system. | A new propulsion system will be installed. |
| In the dynamic section, the kart's braking system is incomplete. | The missing components will be installed and restored. |
| The kart lacks perception, control, and environmental manipulation components. | The necessary equipment will be installed to provide these capabilities to the assembly. |
| The original kart design does not provide spaces to house the mechatronics necessary for the performance of an autonomous system. | A distribution will be planned that is respectful with the pilot. This distribution will also ensure comfortable access to all those components for intervention if necessary. |
| The kart did not include a telemetry and remote control system in its original design. | These systems will be designed and installed on the final platform, so that they are integrated into the prototype's normal operation. |
| Minor aesthetic defects that do not interfere with the prototype's performance. | They will be restored to the extent possible to improve the appearance. |

# Definition of Regulatory Requirements and Limitations

---

This platform is a prototype that is not intended to participate in any competition, therefore no regulations apply to it. However, during the development of both the platform and the subsystems that will be integrated into it, applicable regulations will be evaluated, trying to comply with them to the greatest extent possible. If, due to the iterative nature of the project, some aspects of the regulations are not met, these will not be ignored, but will be documented and taken into account for the project's progress.

Other requirements that must be met during the development of this project are:

- Manual driving capability must be maintained to enable the application of supervised learning algorithms.
- Prioritize the use of standardized components in the karting environment to facilitate integration, maintenance, and repairability. In cases where custom solutions need to be implemented, these must be clearly justified and documented.

# Global Diagram of the Project

---

Due to its numerous components, the kart is a complex project. Following the same architecture as our single-seater vehicle, the assembly will be organized into distinct sections

- **Propulsion.**
    - Motor
    - Battery
    - Drivetrain
- **Dynamics.**
    - **Steering.**
    - **Brakes**.
- **Chassis.**
- **Aerodynamics.**
- **Electronics**.
    - **Control**.
    - **Perception.**
    - **Actuation.**
    - **Telemetry.**

Since the propulsion system will be electric, it has associated electronics for motor control. However, the autonomous system will be abstracted from this direct control, so the electronics associated with motor management will be an integral part of the propulsion system.

The dynamics, steering, and braking subsystems are designed to be operated manually by a driver. The priority will be to respect the original design as much as possible, but components must be added to allow these subsystems to be operated autonomously by the control system.

There are no plans to modify the chassis or aerodynamics sections except for aesthetic factors. Therefore, no additional components will be added beyond those already included in the kart's original design.

Finally, the electronics section will be the most complex, as it will include not only the components related to the prototype's power system but also all those intended for control, perception, actuation, and telemetry tasks.

Each component has a dedicated section on this page with detailed technical specifications beyond just manufacturer and part numbers. This section provides only a general overview of the system.

## Propulsion

### Motor

BLDC motor from [Kunray](https://kunraymotors.com/motor-electrico-bldc/). They also supply the electronics required for motor control.

> Why isn't a thermal engine used?
> 

A thermal engine would add unnecessary complexity and maintenance requirements to the system. It would require managing fuel, exhaust gases and a cooling system, which consume significant physical space. Additionally, electric motors require minimal short or medium-term maintenance. From an electronics perspective, controlling an electric motor is far simpler than managing a thermal engine.

> But the single-seated car has a thermal engine!
> 

That's correct. However, the prototype's purpose isn't to test different engines, but rather to test sensors, actuators, electronics, and most importantly, **software**.

From a software perspective, the engine type â€”whether electric or thermalâ€” doesn't matter as long as the vehicle moves forward when throttle is applied.

> Why the battery is placed at the back?
> 

The rear was the most practical location to accommodate such a large and heavy component. Given the constraints of maintaining the seat, wheel, and pedals in their original positions, we had to make some compromises regarding available space. While a heavy load at the back might typically affect kart handling, this is not a significant concern since the kart will operate autonomously most of the time without a driver's weight.

# FAQ

- Why are you using a pneumatic actuator for the braking system?
    
    If we need a force of 100kgf and a speed of 0.5m/s, the power delivery is 500W. An electric actuator like that is bulky and not that easy to find.
    
    We thought of using a cable with a pulley that wraps in a shaft with a motor and some feedback from the pressure sensor, a control loop. The small pulley would allow for great force, but the cables canâ€™t bend so much.
    
    We already have the piston from Festo, our sponsor, so itâ€™s the easiest solution.
