During development we try to meet any relevant standards and document deviations. Manual driving capability must be preserved for supervised learning.

An electric actuator capable of that is bulky and hard to source. A cable and pulley system with a motor and pressure feedback was considered, but cables cannot bend sharply. Since we already have a pneumatic piston from our sponsor Festo, it is the simplest solution.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#battery","title":"Battery","text":""},{"location":"faq/#why-is-the-battery-placed-at-the-back","title":"Why is the battery placed at the back?","text":"<p>The rear of the kart offered the most practical space for such a large and heavy component. Because the seat, wheels and pedals remain in their original positions, placing the pack behind the driver was the best compromise. Handling is less of a concern since the kart will usually run autonomously without a driver's weight.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#motor-choice","title":"Motor choice","text":""},{"location":"faq/#why-not-use-a-thermal-engine","title":"Why not use a thermal engine?","text":"<p>A combustion engine would add unnecessary complexity such as fuel, exhaust and cooling. Electric motors require little maintenance and are simpler to control electronically. Since this prototype focuses on sensors, actuators and software, the type of engine does not matter as long as the vehicle moves when throttle is applied.</p>"},{"location":"ebs/","title":"Emergency Braking System","text":"<p>The kart uses a pneumatic piston to depress the brake pedal when commanded.
