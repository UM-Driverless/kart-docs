# KART Documentation

## General Description

The project consists of equipping a competition kart with the ability to operate autonomously, integrating perception, control and actuation systems.

## Objectives

Develop a platform to prototype autonomous systems that could later be installed on the singleâ€‘seater race car, and can be used by teachers, students, or researchers to evaluate their algorithms with an outdoor robot, which was not an option until recently. This accelerates innovation and reduces iteration costs.

## Regulatory Requirements and Limitations

This prototype is not intended to compete, so no specific racing regulations apply. During development we try to meet any relevant standards and document deviations. Manual driving capability must be preserved for supervised learning. Wherever possible we favour standardized kart components and only resort to custom solutions when justified.
