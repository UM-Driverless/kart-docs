# Welcome to the Formula Student KART docs

## General Description

The project consists of equipping a competition kart with the ability to operate autonomously, integrating perception, control and actuation systems.

## Objectives

### Main Objective

Develop a platform to prototype autonomous systems that could later be installed on the singleâ€‘seater race car. This accelerates innovation and reduces iteration costs.

### Secondary Objective

Restore the classic competition kart so it is safe and comfortable to work with.

### Problems and Solutions

| PROBLEM | SOLUTION |
| --- | --- |
| The kart lacks a propulsion system. | A new propulsion system will be installed. |
| In the dynamic section, the kart's braking system is incomplete. | The missing components will be installed and restored. |
| The kart lacks perception, control and environmental manipulation components. | The necessary equipment will be installed. |
| The original design has no space for the mechatronics needed for an autonomous system. | A component layout respectful of the driver will be planned to allow easy access. |
| No telemetry or remote control system was included originally. | These systems will be designed and integrated. |
| Minor aesthetic defects. | They will be restored when possible. |

## Regulatory Requirements and Limitations

This prototype is not intended to compete, so no specific racing regulations apply. During development we try to meet any relevant standards and document deviations. Manual driving capability must be preserved for supervised learning. Wherever possible we favour standardized kart components and only resort to custom solutions when justified.

## System Overview

The kart is organised into several sections:

- **Propulsion** (motor, battery, drivetrain)
- **Dynamics** (steering, brakes)
- **Chassis**
- **Aerodynamics**
- **Electronics** (control, perception, actuation, telemetry)
