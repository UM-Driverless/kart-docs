# Battery

The main pack uses **Molicel P42A** cells in a 13S4P configuration, providing a nominal voltage of about 48 V. A separate 12 V car battery supplies the sensors to remain compatible with the Formula Student car. The pack is monitored with a [JBD BMS](https://www.notion.so/BMS-Bater-a-Kart-JBD-16078747314380e68688c3ab787fc1f7?pvs=21).

For battery placement rationale see the [FAQ](../../faq.md#battery).
