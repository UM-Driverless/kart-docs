# kart-docs

Documentation for the autonomous KART project.

This site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

ðŸ“˜ Live site: <https://um-driverless.github.io/kart-docs/>
ðŸ§  Main source: [Notion Kart Documentation](https://www.notion.so/KART-1b378747314380acb23ee354a4a4c4c7)

## ðŸ”§ Setup

Install uv:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
If you dont have curl in your system check this [page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UM-Driverless/kart-docs.git
cd kart-docs
./dev.sh
```

This script:
- Sets up a Python virtual environment using `uv`
- Installs MkDocs + Material theme
- Launches a local preview server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## âœ… Checking changes locally

Preview your edits before committing or pushing to make sure everything looks correct.

**Option 1 â€“ build the static site**

```bash
mkdocs build
# open site/index.html in your browser
```

**Option 2 â€“ run the dev server (auto reloads)**

```bash
mkdocs serve
# then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

These commands do not create any Git commits or deploy the siteâ€”they are purely for local review. Use `mkdocs gh-deploy` only when you're ready to publish.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages run this in the project root:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in the repo settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source: `gh-pages` branch.

## Branch structure

The `gh-pages` branch is automatically managed by `mkdocs gh-deploy`. It holds only the generated site files and should be treated as read-only. All Markdown documentation resides on the `main` branch. Edit files on `main` and deploy to update `gh-pages`.
